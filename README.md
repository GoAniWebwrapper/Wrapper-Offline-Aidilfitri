# Wrapper: Offline 1.3.0 Aidliftri Raya Release 1
Raya Update After the dreaded, unstable 1.3.0 release of Wrapper: Offline, Wrapper: Offline (Revision) was created. (simply called "Revision" for the rest of this page) Unlike the original Wrapper: Offline, Revision focuses on simplicity and *stability* while also providing users a pleasant experience. Revision will continue to get updates in the future.

## What is Wrapper: Offline?
After learning that GoAnimate Wrapper (a project by VisualPlugin) would be shut down, Wrapper: Offline was created. (simply called "Offline" for the rest of this page) Unlike the original project, Offline can not be shut down or "patched". You have the files all on your computer. This project is important for historical and archival purposes, as the ability to use this legacy editor and themes would be completely gone without it. Besides simply emulating the original Flash editor, some additional features and improvements have been made. And Offline will also continue to get additional updates in the future.

## Running / Installation
To start Revision on Windows, open start_wrapper.bat. It'll automate just about everything for you and, well, start Wrapper: Offline (Revision). On your first run, you will likely need to right-click it and click "Run as Administrator". This allows it to properly install what it needs to run. After your initial run, you shouldn't need to do that again, you can start it as normal.

If you want to import videos and characters from the original Wrapper or any other clones of it, open its folder and drag the "_SAVED" folder into Revision's "wrapper" folder. If you have already made any videos or characters, this will not work. Please only import on a new install with no saved characters or videos, or take the "_SAVED" folder in Revision out before dragging the old one in. If you want to import character IDs from the original LVM, you can paste `&original_asset_id=[ID HERE]` at the end of the link for the matching character creator.

## Updates & Support
For support, the first thing you should do is read through faq.txt, it most likely has what you want to know. If you can't find what you need, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Kf7BzSw). Joining the server is mandatory if support is needed, as there is a whole community to help you out.

## Dependencies
This program relies on Flash, Node.js and http-server to work properly. SilentCMD is also used to suppress all the extra logging noise you'd only need for troubleshooting and development. These all have been included with the project (utilities folder) to ensure full offline operation and will be installed if missing. The "wrapper" folder and http-server have their own dependencies, but they are included as well.

## License
Most of this project is free/libre software[1] under the MIT license. You have the freedom to run, change, and share this as much as you want.
This includes:
  - Files in the "wrapper" folder
  - Batch files made for Wrapper: Offline edited for Wrapper: Offline (Revision)
  - Node.js
  - http-server
  - SilentCMD
  - Chromium Web Store

ungoogled-chromium is under the BSD 3-Clause license, which grants similar rights, but has some differences from MIT. MediaInfo has a similar BSD 2-Clause license. 7zip's license is mostly LGPL, but some parts are under the BSD 3-clause License, and some parts have an unRAR restriction. Stylus is under the GNU GPLv3 license. These licenses can be found in each program's folder in utilities\sourcecode.

The source code for compiled programs are all stored in utilities\sourcecode, and you can modify these as you wish. Parts of Revision that run from their source code directly (such as batch scripts) are not included in that folder, for obvious reasons.

Flash Player (utilities folder) and GoAnimate's original assets (server folder) are proprietary and do not grant you these rights, but if they did, this project wouldn't need to exist. Requestly, an addon included in Revision's browser, is sadly proprietary software, but you're free to remove the Chromium profile and use a fresh one if this bothers you. Requestly is primarily included because of how popular it is with our community.

While completely unnecessary, if you decide to use your freedom to change the software, it would be greatly appreciated if you sent it to me so I can implement it into the main program! With credit down here of course :)

These are unaffiliated people that they haven't directly done anything for the project (and probably don't even know it exists) but still deserve credit for their things. Kinda like a shoutout but in a project's readme. ***Please do not contact them about Wrapper: Offline (Revision).***
